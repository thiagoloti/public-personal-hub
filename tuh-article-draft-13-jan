Did the US deploy sonic weapons during the Venezuela operation?

The confirmed military operation in Venezuela

On 3 January 2026, the United States carried out a highly secretive military incursion into Venezuela, known as "Operation Absolute Resolve." This mission, verified by sources such as the New York Times and corroborated in public records like Wikipedia, led to the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro under the cloak of early morning darkness.

The scale of the attack was formidable, involving over 150 military aircraft including a combination of drones and fighter jets. In addition, specialised EA-18G Growler aircraft were deployed to disable Venezuelan radar installations, clearing the path for air and ground operations. Satellite imagery later confirmed significant destruction across key military sites.

Allegations of sonic or directed energy weapon use

Amidst the vivid details of the assault, a particular claim stands out: the possibility that the US employed a sonic or directed energy weapon. Published initially by the New York Post and amplified by the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, the extraordinary testimony came from a Venezuelan guard who reported soldiers bleeding from their noses and vomiting blood. The effects were described as feeling like "head exploding from within," implying a weapon capable of causing internal haemorrhaging without external trauma.

The claim paints a picture of around twenty American soldiers using this advanced technology against hundreds of Venezuelan defenders while escaping unharmed. Such an account suggests a significant leap in battlefield weaponry that could alter combat dynamics drastically.

Verification challenges and expert insights

Despite the compelling narrative, independent verification of sonic or directed energy weapon deployment remains lacking. Intelligence sources cited by the Post confirm that the US has possessed such weapons for years, theoretically capable of causing physical symptoms like bleeding, pain, and motor impairment. Nonetheless, experts are divided on whether this incident genuinely involved these devices or if it represents a psychological operation designed to sow confusion and fear.

Adding complexity, the confirmed casualties numbered between 40 and 100 Venezuelan military and civilians, with seven American soldiers injured primarily by shrapnel and gunfire rather than the effects of an energy weapon. This indicates that traditional combat forces played a substantial role alongside any technological interventions.

The broader implications of novel warfare technologies

If validated, the use of sonic or directed energy weapons would mark a watershed moment in modern warfare. Such weapons offer a non-lethal yet debilitating alternative to conventional arms, capable of incapacitating opponents rapidly without overt destruction. Moreover, the potential for psychological impact and deniable engagement lends itself well to covert operations and information warfare.

However, scepticism remains healthy in the face of extraordinary claims. Without solid evidence, these reports risk becoming part of disinformation campaigns that complicate international discourse. The blend of dramatic personal testimonies, media hype, and official silence creates fertile ground for speculation.

What remains confirmed from Operation Absolute Resolve

The operation itself is unequivocal in its effectiveness and scale. Its successful execution involved a sophisticated aerial campaign, electronic warfare that neutralised enemy surveillance, and ground forces capable of capturing the Venezuelan leader. The casualties and destruction reported confirm a fierce confrontation rather than a bloodless technological triumph.

Understanding this context helps frame the sonic weapon allegations not as standalone facts but as part of a broader story involving revolutionary military tactics and the fog of modern conflict. Whether these advanced weapons were truly deployed or not, the operation signals a shift in how states may conduct future interventions.

Conclusion: balancing scepticism and curiosity in new military tech

As military technology evolves at an unprecedented pace, stories like the Venezuelan incursion invite us to reconsider what is possible on today's battlefield. Sonic and directed energy weapons may soon transition from speculative science fiction to routine instruments of war.

For now, the absence of clear proof means these claims should be met with cautious intrigue. They urge analysts, journalists, and citizens to remain vigilant, urging deeper scrutiny and transparency in military affairs. Only then can we separate fact from fiction and truly understand the emerging face of conflict.
